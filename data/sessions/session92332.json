 "description": "You can now easily customize any SharePoint list form in PowerApps. Much of what we were doing with InfoPath is possible with PowerApps.  In a world where the end-users are handling information that is probably stored across different software suites, like SharePoint, Excel file, Access database, this comes like a killer feature. PowerApps is directly integrated with SharePoint and with PowerApps, you can create richly customized forms without any code. Once published, the forms are embedded within the SharePoint list and are available to all users of the list. Join me in this session on extending your business processes and explore the new concepts of zero-code apps!",
