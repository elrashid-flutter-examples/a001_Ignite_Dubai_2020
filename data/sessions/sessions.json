We start with a discussion of what cloud computing is and what Azure offers you and your team. We then take a look at basic services and features, setting up an account and subscription along the way. Finally, we tour the Azure Portal and do a quick overview of the resources available and what they do.\r\n",

We start with a discussion of what cloud computing is and what Azure offers you and your team. We then take a look at basic services and features, setting up an account and subscription along the way.

We also talk about deployment slots that enable easy A/B testing of new features and show how Snapshot Debugging can be used to live debug applications. From there, we explore how you can use other tools to manage your websites and containers live.\r\n",

Some of the most common questions getting asked within the company are: “How do we know what we're looking for? Do we look at logs? Metrics? Both?” Using Azure Monitor and Application Insights helps Tailwind Traders elevate their application logs to something a bit more powerful: telemetry. In session, you’ll learn how the team wired up Application Insights to their public-facing website and fixed a slow-loading home page. Then, we expand this concept of telemetry to determine how Tailwind Traders’ CosmosDB  performance could be improved. Finally, we’ll look into capacity planning and scale with powerful yet easy services like Azure Front Door.",

In a world where the end-users are handling information that is probably stored across different software suites, like SharePoint, Excel file, Access database, this comes like a killer feature. PowerApps is directly integrated with SharePoint and with PowerApps, you can create richly customized forms without any code. Once published, the forms are embedded within the SharePoint list and are available to all users of the list.

From there, we look at examples of partners who use the Microsoft Graph APIs to extend many of the same Microsoft Graph-powered experiences into their apps, and close by showing you how easy it is to get started building Microsoft Graph-powered apps of your own.",

    "description": "SharePoint is the bedrock of enterprise intranets, while Microsoft Teams is the new collaboration tool on the block. In this session we look at each product individually, then show you how they can work together. We start with an overview of the SharePoint Framework and modern, cross-platform intranet development. We pivot to an overview of Microsoft Teams extensibility and demonstrate how to increase the speed relevance of collaboration in your organization. Finally, we put the two together – with a little help from Microsoft Graph - and show you how a single application can run in both applications.",

    "description": "Even the smallest gaps between people and systems in your organization can cost time and money. The Microsoft 365 platform has powerful solutions for professional and citizen developers that can close those gaps. We begin this session by showing you some low- and no-code business process automation scenarios using Microsoft PowerApps, Microsoft Flow and Excel. From there, we show you how adaptive cards and actionable messages can increase the velocity, efficiency, and productivity of your business. Finally, we demonstrate how to remain engaged with other software tools without switching context using Office add-ins.",
