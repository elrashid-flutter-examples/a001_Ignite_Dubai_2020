Stop by to learn six proven steps to successfully drive adoption. We’ll share how to start with the end in mind, how to focus on small victory laps, how to split governance, how to show more than tell to drive adoption with field-proven techniques!

Note: we’ll take you on a helicopter ride over the process but land that helicopter several times show the details. To say it differently, don’t expect a session full of slides and talking.",
