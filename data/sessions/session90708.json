 "description": "Moving to the cloud often means rethinking ways in which users connect to services, as well as how organizations secure that connectivity flow. Traditional organizational boundaries that defined how and where users communicate and collaborate are no longer in place. With this shift comes new network connectivity paradigms that can dramatically improve end-user experience, bolster productivity, and may even result in dramatic cost savings to organizations. In this session, we will cover practical guidance that can help you achieve excellent performance and reliability with Microsoft 365, and demonstrate the latest network-focused additions to Microsoft 365 services.",
