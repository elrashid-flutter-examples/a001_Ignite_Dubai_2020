 "description": "It is pretty clear that we have a smart new generation who understands how to get around computer systems — some are doing it just for fun, while others are doing it with a slightly more sinister intent! Let's stop there and let it sink in for a moment. Cybercrime is a very lucrative business not just because of the potential financial return, but because it’s quite easy to get away with it. Did you see all these news stories about identity thieves? Why are hackers targeting those computers and not the others? Usually the hacker's or cyber bully’s goal is very simple: let's do whatever is possible. Our response should be: 'Do whatever you want but somewhere else!'. During Paula's session you will learn how to recognize  cyber bullying, how to avoid these activities and how to stop blackmailing, phishing or the data breaches that litter the news sites nowadays. Come and enjoy the live-experience presentation with engaging stories and demos!",
