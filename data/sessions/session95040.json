 "description": "During this talk, the speaker describes several methods to scale Data Science across a “traditional” enterprise. Such practices include the end-to-end use-cases life cycle, from demand creation towards deployment, including frameworks for prioritizing use-cases, developing use-cases, and path-to-production.   He also addresses several technical components, from standard DevOps methods to build a Data Science Platform that scales on the cloud to standard docker images to accelerate and automate the deployment of use-cases. It is essential to highlight that this talk will not go deep in Machine Learning methods to solve a particular problem but instead highlight how to enable many machine learning libraries and the framework to solve multiple use-cases across the Enterprise.",
