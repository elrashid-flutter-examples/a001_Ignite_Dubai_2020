 "description": "According to the World Health Organization, more than 1 billion people worldwide experience some form of disability.    Designing for inclusivity not only opens up products and services to more people, it also reflects how people really are. All humans grow and adapt to the world around them and we want our designs to reflect that. Everyone has abilities, and limits to those abilities. Designing for people with permanent disabilities actually results in designs that benefit people universally.   AI is now capable of hearing, seeing, and reasoning with increasing accuracy. Real-time speech-to-text transcription, computer vision capabilities, and predictive text functionality are just a few examples of how AI is useful to people with disabilities today.    Come and join Microsoft experts for an enlightening session, where you will learn how Microsoft is approaching inclusive design,  accessibility and AI to empower people and organizations in the workplace.  This session is designed for business and IT leaders responsible for creating culture of work, employee experience, collaboration, and diversity & inclusion.",
