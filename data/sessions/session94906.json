 "description": "Dementia is a broad category of brain diseases that cause decline of cognitive ability. There are 50 million people living with dementia worldwide. In this session we will discuss our solution which uses Artificial Intelligence and aims to increase quality of life for those suffering from this disease, reduce the family care burden, and increase care access to low-and middle-income countries.  AI for Dementia Solution comprises of two areas:  •\tPatient Virtual Assistant Bot and Dashboard which aims to help patients live more autonomously in non-advanced stages of Dementia.  •\tConnected Patient Monitoring which aims to allow caregivers and family members to monitor patients remotely. Some of the technologies used in solution are AI Custom Vision, Vision AI Dev Kit, Bot Framework 4.4, Bing Map, Application Insights, Azure Cognitive services, Azure IOT Edge and HUB, Azure storage, Azure Logic Apps, C#, Twilio Join Fauzia Awan, Principal Premier Field Engineer at Microsoft EMEA as she does a walkthrough of her team’s Tech for Good journey, including: 1.\tInspiration for the project 2.\tPurpose and goal 3.\tSolution Overview 4.\tDiscussion on Connected Patient Monitoring",
