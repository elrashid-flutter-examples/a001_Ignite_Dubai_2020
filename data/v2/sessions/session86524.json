 "description": "When your growth or the demand for your systems exceeds, or is projected to exceed, your current capacity – that’s a “good” problem to have. However, this can be just as much of a threat to your system’s reliability as any other factor.  \r\n\r\nIn this session, dive into capacity planning and cost estimation basics, including the tools Azure provides to help with both. We wrap up with a discussion and demonstration of how Tailwind Traders judiciously applied Azure scaling features. Learn how to satisfy your customers and a growing demand, even when “challenged” by success.\r\n",

   "description": "You‘re concerned about the reliability of your systems, services, and products. Where should you start? In this session, get an introduction to modern operations disciplines and a framework for reliability work. We jump into monitoring: the foundational practice you must tackle before you can make any headway with reliability. Using Tailwind Traders as an example, we demonstrate how to monitor your environment, including the right (and wrong) things to monitor – and why. You’ll leave with the crucial tools and knowledge you need to discuss and improve reliability using objective data.\r\n",

The key question is whether you treat them as a learning opportunity to make your operations practice better or just as a loss of time, money, and reputation.  \r\n\r\nIn this session, dive into one of the most important topics for improving reliability: how to learn from failure. We listen into one of Tailwind Traders post-incident reviews, often called a postmortem, and use that to learn how to shape and run this process to turn a failure into something actionable. After this session, you’ll be able to build a key feedback loop in your organization that turns unplanned outages into opportunities.\r\n",
