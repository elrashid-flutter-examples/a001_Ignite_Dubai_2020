But now that they are on the cloud it’s time to add cool features using simple scripts to access powerful services that automatically scale and run exactly where and when they need them. This includes language translation, image recognition, and other AI/ML features. \r\n\r\nIn this session, we create a set of routines that run on Azure Functions, respond to events in Azure Event Grid, and then orchestrate these functions and messages with Azure Logic Apps. We also use Azure Cognitive Services to add AI capabilities and Xamarin to implement AR features with a phone app.\r\n",
