From there, we look at examples of partners who use the Microsoft Graph APIs to extend many of the same Microsoft Graph-powered experiences into their apps, and close by showing you how easy it is to get started building Microsoft Graph-powered apps of your own.",

We pivot to an overview of Microsoft Teams extensibility and demonstrate how to increase the speed relevance of collaboration in your organization. Finally, we put the two together – with a little help from Microsoft Graph - and show you how a single application can run in both applications.",
