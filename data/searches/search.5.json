     "description": "When Tailwind Traders acquired Northwind earlier this year, they decided to consolidate their on-premises applications with Tailwind Traders’ current applications running on Azure. Their goal: vastly simplify the complexity that comes with an on-premises installation. \r\n\r\nIn this session, examine how a cloud architecture frees you up to focus on your applications, instead of your infrastructure. Then, see the options to “lift and shift” a web application to Azure, including: how to deploy, manage, monitor, and backup both a Node.js and .NET Core API, using Virtual Machines and Azure App Service.\r\n",

We also talk about deployment slots that enable easy A/B testing of new features and show how Snapshot Debugging can be used to live debug applications. From there, we explore how you can use other tools to manage your websites and containers live.\r\n",

Then, we add automated operations that developers control like A/B testing and automated approval gates.

     "description": "Who hasn’t been scared when deploying a new feature to a website? Sometimes we feel that we will break everything, and the stress level is just not something we want to experience ever again. That's why the deployment slots feature of Azure App Services is such a nice experience. With deployment slots, you can deploy to a safe slot in the same conditions as your production environment. You can test in isolation, without risking breaking something. Then you can gradually route some of the traffic to the new features, for example to perform A/B testing. When you are satisfied with the results, you can simply switch the whole traffic to the new site. But don't fret, if something goes wrong, the old, safe site is just one mouse click away.",
