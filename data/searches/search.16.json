In this session, we start at the beginning, introducing Azure and the core concepts that are foundational to our cloud platform. We start with a discussion of what cloud computing is and what Azure offers you and your team. We then take a look at basic services and features, setting up an account and subscription along the way. Finally, we tour the Azure Portal and do a quick overview of the resources available and what they do.\r\n",
